What makes sense in Christmas?

Our children dressed in Santa outfit or receiving gifts from Santa does not make sense. 
Our family picture in our best dresses with Merry Christmas scribbled does not make sense. 
The only thing that makes sense is the picture of God's Love in baby Jesus lying in a manger with an eye to the cross of Calvary.
