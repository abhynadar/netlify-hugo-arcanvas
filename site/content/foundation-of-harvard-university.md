With some 17,000 Puritans migrating to New England by 1636, Harvard was founded in anticipation of the need for training clergy for the new commonwealth, a **"church in the wilderness"**. In 1639, it was renamed Harvard College after clergyman John Harvard, a University of Cambridge alumnus who had willed the new school Â£779 pounds sterling and his library of some 400 books. The early motto of Harvard was **Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae**, meaning **"Truth for Christ and the Church"**
