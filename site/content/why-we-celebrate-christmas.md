Why we celebrate Christmas?

This is the day when God gave us a child - Jesus Christ, who will be whipped so that we may be healed, whose hands and feet will be nailed so that we may be forgiven, whose forehead would bleed from a crown of thorns pressed down so that our curses may be broken, whose body will be pierced with spear so that our lives can be spared, whose body will be hung on a cross so that we may receive life though his death.
